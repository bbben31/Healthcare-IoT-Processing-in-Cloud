# Healthcare-IoT-Processing-in-Cloud


We’ll be building up on the IoT Core and DynamoDB lab. The device
simulator will publish Heart Rate, SpO2 (Oxygen Saturation) and Body Temperature values
periodically. 

We’ll need to channel that to the cloud (Iot Core → DynamoDB), and then
aggregate data and detect anomalies.
